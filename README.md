# Squash Compression Benchmark Web Site

This is the web site used to present the official results for the
Squash Compression Benchmark.

This is the development versionâ€”to see the latest stable version (run
against the latest stable version of Squash), please visit the
[Squash Compression Benchmark web site](https://quixdb.github.io/squash-benchmark/).
There is currently no live view of the development version, but you
can always clone the repository.  You'll need to run it with a web
server (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` works) so the links to external
resources work.
